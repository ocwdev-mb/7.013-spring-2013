Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 3 sessions / week, 1 hour / session

Recitations: 2 sessions / week, 1 hour / session

Prerequisites
-------------

There are no formal prerequisites for this course, but we do presuppose high school-level biology and chemistry (especially familiarity with the fundamental aspects of chemical structure).

Before taking this course, you may want to review _[Pre-7.01 Getting up to Speed in Biology](/courses/res-7-001-pre-7-01-getting-up-to-speed-in-biology-summer-2019)_, a self-paced course designed to help prepare students for their first college-level biology class.

Text
----

The required textbook is: Campbell, N. A., J. B. Reece, et al. _Campbell Biology_. 9th ed. Benjamin Cummings, 2010. ISBN: 9780321558237.

Recitations
-----------

Regular weekly attendance is expected. Each recitation section meets twice per week for 50 minutes. Recitation problems and solutionsÂ  are available in the {{% resource_link 48d0ccdf-e4b4-c9ed-48e6-c3149ea3b5f2 "recitations" %}} section.

Tutors
------

Tutors are available at no charge for all MIT students who wish to have extra help with the course material, either on a one-time or on a regular basis.

Assignments
-----------

There will be 7 graded problem sets, but only your best 6 problem set scores will be used in determining your grade. Although you may engage in general discussions of problems, sharing of answers is a violation of the trust placed in all students in the class, each of whom is entrusted with producing her/his own set of answers. Students who copy problem set answers or allow their problem sets to be copied may receive a 0 for all the problem sets (and thus lose approximately 16.5% of the grade).

Exams
-----

There will be three exams worth 100 points each given during the term and a comprehensive final worth 200 points given during finals week. The Final Exam will be a 3-hour, cumulative exam, covering the entire course.
